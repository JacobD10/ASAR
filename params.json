It will, at the same\r\ntime, attempt to start recording the audio on a third party piece of software installed locally. If all is successful,\r\nsupport will be added to determine the angle of rotation and visually display this information. This project is a\r\nVisual C++ project and has the capability of being able to display many features of audio, this is currently a stretch goal.\r\n\r\nMore information will be added here as this project kicks off...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
