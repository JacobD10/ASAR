###Automated Spatial Audio Recorder

---------------------------------

This project is managed by:
- **Jacob Donley**  (jrd089@uowmail.edu.au) and
- **Matthew Dabin** (md026@uowmail.edu.au)

ASAR is a UOW research project and is being made open source in the hope to benefit other researchers.
For more information on the type of research we do visit our supervisor, ***A/Prof Christian Ritz's*** [webpage][1].

This particular software project has aims to automatically record spatial audio using our rotating platform hardware.
The software will send serial commands to the micro controller in order to rotate the platform. It will, at the same
time, attempt to start recording the audio on a third party piece of software installed locally. If all is successful,
support will be added to determine the angle of rotation and visually display this information. This project is a
Visual C++ project and has the capability of being able to display many features of audio, this is currently a stretch goal.

More information will be added here as this project kicks off...
