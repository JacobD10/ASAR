Automated Spatial Audio Recorder

This project is managed by Jacob Donley (jrd089@uowmail.edu.au) and Matthew Dabin (md026@uowmail.edu.au).
It is a research project and is being made open source in the hope to benefit other researchers.

This particular software project has aims to automatically record spatial audio using our rotating platform hardware. The software will send serial commands to the micro controller in order to rotate the platform. It will, at the same time, attempt to start recording the audio on a third party piece of software installed locally. If all is successful, support will be added to determine the angle of rotation and visually display this information. This project is a Visual C++ project and has the capability of being able to display many features of audio, this is currently a stretch goal.

More information will be added here as this project kicks off...
