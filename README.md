ASAR is a UOW research project and is being made open source in the hope to benefit other researchers.
For more information on the type of research we do visit our supervisor, ***A/Prof Christian Ritz's*** [webpage][4].

This particular software project has aims to automatically record spatial audio using our rotating platform hardware.
The software will send serial commands to the micro-controller in order to rotate the platform. It will, at the same
time, attempt to start recording the audio on a third party piece of software installed locally. If all is successful,
support will be added to determine the angle of rotation and visually display this information. This project is a
Visual C# project and has the capability of being able to display many features of audio, this is currently a stretch goal.

More information will be added here as this project kicks off...
