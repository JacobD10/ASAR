This particular software project has aims to automatically record spatial audio using our rotating platform hardware. The software will send serial commands to a micro-controller in order to rotate the platform. It will, at the same time, start recording the audio in third party software installed locally. Support to determine the angle of rotation and visually display this information will be implemented. This project is a Visual C# project and has the capability of displaying many different aspects of live and recorded audio. 

More information will be added here as this project kicks off...
